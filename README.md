# Team Workflow Log

This repository demonstrates a simple GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Appends an "Updated by … on …" line to `index.html`.
- Appends a timestamped log entry (with short commit SHA) to this README.

## GitHub Pages
After enabling **Settings → Pages → Source = main / (root)**, this site will publish from `index.html`.
